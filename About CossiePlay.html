		<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. <br>We create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. <br>Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.</p>
		<br>
		<p>We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is available) as well.<br>
        On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall.<br> Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. <br>Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. <br>Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. <br>There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required).
